    Check to see if the atom is a possible aromatic.
    </p>
    <p>
    This procedure does (and should) not require the presence of
    implicit hydrogens to work.
    </p>
    <p>
    All aromatic atoms obey the following rules:
    </p>
    <p>
    1. It must be one of the possible aromatic elements. 2. It cannot
    have a connectivity of more than 3 (including implicit
    hydrogens - although these are not important for determining
    aromaticity). 3. Carbons must be sp or sp2 hybridized (i.e. have
    attached multiple    bonds or be only 3-connected) but there are
    no such limitations on    other atoms. 4. It must be in a ring and
    bound to at least two other possible    aromatic elements that are
    also in rings.
    </p>
    <p>
    Element-specific rules:
    </p>
    <p>
    C: The third connection can be a single bond to any other atom
    (I),    although double bonds to non-carbon, non-ring atoms are
    allowed    too (as long as the total valence is 4) (II).
    </p>
    <p>
    N, P, As: These atoms can be 3-coordinate and 3-valence (I) or
    2-coordinate or 3-coordinate and 4-valence in which case
    the double bond must be to an extra-cyclic oxygen (II).
    </p>
    <p>
    O: Oxygen can only ever have two connections (I).
    </p>
    <p>
    S, Se: These atoms can be 2-coordinate or 3-coordinate and
    4-valence with the third connection a double bond to an
    extra-cyclic oxygen (I).
    </p>
    <p>
    Donated electrons and extra valencies:
    </p>
    <p>
    Element            Case     Donated Electrons      Extra Valence
    </p>
    <p>
    C                    I              1                    1
    II             0                    0 N, P, As             I
    2                    0                      II             1
    1 O                    I              2                    0 S, Se
    I              2                    0
    </p>
    <p>
    The number of donated electrons is augmented or diminished by the
    charge on the atom.
    </p>
    <p>
    User-specified aromatics must obey the same rules. If they do not
    an error is produced. A user-specified aromatic does, however,
    indicate that a carbon is sp/sp2 hybridized even it only has
    single bonds. It also changes slightly the way in which N, P and
    As are handled.
