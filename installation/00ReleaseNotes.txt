Release Notes:
==============

------------------------------
Version 1.9.0 (November 2014):
------------------------------

* A minor release with many incremental changes and bug fixes. Changes include many small modifications to
  help in the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, and the introduction of a more efficient WHAM module
  (and accompanying tutorial).

------------------------------
Version 1.8.0 (November 2013):
------------------------------

* A major release but with changes that should be compatible with version 1.7.2. Changes include:

    - Additional of new capabilities including the reading of CIF files and DCD trajectories, an
      extensive list of new DFT functionals, and a CI capability and d-orbitals for the MNDO QC models.

    - A generalized import and export facility in pBabel.

    - Optimization and parallelization of some of the code, including:

      - The option to use the optimized ATLAS blas and lapack libraries in place of the built-in ones.
      - Implementation of a fast non-bonding list update scheme.
      - OpenMP parallelization of the ABFS non-bonding calculation, some parts of the QC SCF calculation
        and the parts of a DFT calculation that use numerical integration. 
      - Parallel NEB using MPI.

---------------------------
Version 1.7.2 (April 2012):
---------------------------

* A major release with many changes some of which are not backward compatible. Notable modifications
include:

    - Cython is used to compile the extension modules and Pyrex is no longer supported.

    - All package parameter directories have been grouped into a single directory.

    - An overhaul of serialization protocols with the aim of making serialization files (PKL and YAML)
      readable between different versions of the program (eventually).

    - Conversion of all parameters files to YAML from XPK format.

    - Removal of the XML/XPK serialization options.

------------------------
Version 1.5 (July 2010):
------------------------

* A major release with many changes that are not backward compatible. Notable modifications include:

    - The name of the pDynamo package is now pMolecule.

    - pMoleculeScripts is now a package.

    - Package tests have been added.

    - Conversion of many keyword argument and variable names to camel case.

    - Windows installation instructions and set up kindly provided by William E. Wheeler.

These changes will require the editing of user scripts and will also cause most existing "pkl" and
"xpk" files to be unreadable. The latter will need to be reconstructed.

---------------------------
Version 1.4.2 (April 2010):
---------------------------

* A minor release to correct some bugs and provide some additional capabilities. Many changes.

-------------------------------
Version 1.4.1 (September 2008):
-------------------------------

* A minor release to correct some bugs and provide some additional capabilities. Changes include:

    - Correction of a bug (in blas) so that 64-bit machines are now supported.

    - A preliminary, complete version of the PDB tutorial is available.

    - A getting started tutorial has been added that employs some of the examples from the pDynamo
      book.

    - pDynamo's PDB data structures have been reorganized. These will likely change again though.

    - Most pDynamo data structures can now be pickled. Usage follows XMLPickle/XMLUnpickle (with
      Pickle/Unpickle instead) but is faster and takes up less disk space.

    - Installation now works with the latest versions of Pyrex and also of Cython.

    - A velocity Verlet Langevin dynamics algorithm has been added.

-----------------------
Version 1.4 (May 2008):
-----------------------

* Major changes:

    - Addition of an in-built DFT QC method.

    - Coupling to the ORCA ab initio and DFT QC program.

    - Addition of the PM6 semi-empirical method (sp orbitals only for the moment).

    - Replacement of the AM1 semi-empirical method by the OPLS-AA force field in the examples
      involving cyclohexane. The programs are the same (except for the use of a different potential)
      but the OPLS-AA force gives reasonable cyclohexane energies and structures whereas the AM1
      method does not.

* Many minor changes (additions, bug fixes, reorganizations).
